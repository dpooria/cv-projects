Programs use amadillo and openblas library for LA and system gnuplot to plot data; If these packages are installed
on your system then programs can be compiled and run with "main.sh". 
1- Class Dataset is used to do the computations on each dataset, It has functions to calculte pdf, error of pdf and joint pdf of the dataset.
From The plots driven from this program we conclude that as t sieze to infinity:
	P(x(t+tau),x(t)) ---> P(x(t+tau)) * P(x(t))

2- The data's been generated by assumming T(i) = 2N/i and by using the ortho normality between sinusoidal set: 
	A(i) = \sum_t{ x(t)Sin(2pi*t/T(i)) } * (2/N)

D: From power spectrum of sunspot plot we can see frequncies happenning in idexes ~ {150, 700, 1500, 2200, 3000}. We can find out the proportional month in this indexes from file sunspot.txt
